#First Day at Flatiron Labs

#### Congratulations on joining the team at Flatiron Labs! This is a guide of helpful todos, links, and resources to ease your transition and guide you through the first day.

### Ask Mike Linshi about the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/ufYkaydb/onboarding)
- Completing that will take care of most the stuff you need company wide. After you get the accounts you need, come on back here.

###Environment Setup
- Make sure you have [your ideal environment set up](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/ruby-environment-setup).
- If you see a 404 when clicking on this link, ask Jonas to give you permission to access the learn-co-curriculum organization.

###Tools You Might Consider:
- A list of Github [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/) that you might want to consider using.
- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac.
- [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com/) is the easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on Mac.
- [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/), [Breeze](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breeze/id414857071?mt=12), and [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) are all windows management apps. Choose one.


###What You Should Learn For Today:

#### Git workflow

- We use `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` in pretty much all cases. You can read about that [here](http://flatiron-labs.tumblr.com/post/80179930200/git-pull-rebase-vs-git-pull).
- Flatiron Labs uses a Github workflow close to what is outlined [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/the-golden-rule-of-rebasing).
- We currently use [zenhub](https://www.zenhub.io/) to organize features, communicate to each other what we are working on, and prioritize. You must have a license so if you can't get access, you should ask JM or Jonas.

####Our Application Ecosystem
We maintain a collection of internal services, each with their own set of responsibilities.

See how they connect:

See how we talk about them:

- You'll want to get familiar with the Flatiron Labs [Githhub Repository](https://github.com/flatiron-labs) and The Flatiron Labs [wiki](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/wiki). You are going to want to check out [Ironboard](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ironboard) which is the internal project name for the code that runs Learn.co. Here is an [introduction](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ironboard/wiki/Intro-to-Learn) to how it works under the hood and we also have a [script to help you](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ironboard#1-learn-development-for-devs-on-ib) spin it up locally. Also check out:
  - [Ironbroker](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/iron-broker)
  - [Curriculum](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/lms-curriculum-app)
  - [Ironbuild](https://github.com/flatiron-school/iron-build-manager)
  - [Environmentalizer](https://github.com/flatiron-school/environmentalizer)
  - [Ironboard Gem](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ironboard-gem)
  - [Registrar](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/registrar)
  - [People](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/hire-crm) which is internally named Hire
  - [Operations](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/operations), you will need to do stuff with your SSH keys on the servers.

### This is not a finished onboarding workflow

  - Please take some time to reflect on this process and make PRs as needed to update this and other onboarding documents as necessary.
