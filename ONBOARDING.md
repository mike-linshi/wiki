###What You Should Learn For Today:

- We use `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull`. You can read about that [here](http://flatiron-labs.tumblr.com/post/80179930200/git-pull-rebase-vs-git-pull).

- You'll want to get familiar with the Flatironlabs Labs [Githhub Repository](https://github.com/flatiron-labs) and The Flatiron Labs [wiki](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/wiki)

###Your First Project:
- For your first project you'll be adding yourself to the Flatiron Labs website. You can use this [guide](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/wiki/blob/master/PROFILE.md) for direction on how to do that.
