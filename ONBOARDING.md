###What You Should Learn For Today:

Flatiron Labs uses a [development model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) work flow. Read more about that [here]((http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

and you'll need to know why we use `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` you can read about that [here](http://flatiron-labs.tumblr.com/post/80179930200/git-pull-rebase-vs-git-pull).

You'll want to get familiar with the Flatironlabs Labs [Githhub Repository](https://github.com/flatiron-labs) and The Flatiron Labs [wiki](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/wiki)

###Your First Project:
For your first project you'll be adding yourself to the Flatiron Labs website. You can use this [guide](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/wiki/blob/master/PROFILE.md) for direction on how to do that.
