#To Do

1) `Develop` and `Master` branches: Loop Sara and Spencer into the conversation before making a decision.

2) Specify the As/I/So section (copied below). "As a <role>, I need to <do smtg> so that <reason/action>"

```
Each feature is described using three words: As, I, and So. The feature story describes the general feature in terms of who the user is (As), what the user should expect to see (I), and what the expected result is once the user finishes interacting with the login page(So).
```

3) `Given/When/Then` should also map back to the 3 A's ===> make this explicit

4) Every app needs a *launch checklist*
eg. meta tags, GA, favicon, taking down staging data, make sure all images have alt attributes
TL;DR Jonas will send this out.

## Style Guide

1) 2 space indent
2) READABILITY: Spacing between CSS / JS Functions / Methods, etc... = 1 empty line
3) `js` appended to `class`es and `id`s that are javascript-ed
4) Pivotal Card ID in branch and commit message
      POSS EXAMPLE BRANCH: 123456789_new_feature
      POSS EXAMPLE COMMIT: [123456789] started new feature
